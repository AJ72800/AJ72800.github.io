                <p>Do you know why Messi is the best player I've ever seen in my life? Because he is a competitor. He's an animal. Messi pass the ball and goes in like a machine. He smells the goal.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Every time we face each other, whether in the national team or in the Champions League, it's very difficult to face him. No matter how much you study, you will never understand the quality he has and the difference he can make. At certain times, he pulls something else out of the hat that you cannot imagine. That's his difference.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>There is no-one who is at his level, he seems to play like a PlayStation player. Nobody comes close to Messi. Tell me who... Cristiano (Ronaldo) is a goal scorer, (Andres) Iniesta is a brain, (Mohamed) Salah, (Sadio) Mane, (Eden) Hazard and (Kylian) Mbappe are excellent players, but Messi is all that together.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>He is a great player, one of the greatest in the history of football. I know that the expectations around him are enormous and what he has already achieved as a footballer is something that perhaps no one will achieve. Maybe you have to wait 100 years for someone like him to be born again. With what he has already done, he is and will be one of the greatest in all of history.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>He is always going forwards. He never passes the ball backwards or sideways. He has only one idea, to run towards the goal. So as a football fan, just enjoy the show.</p>
